# MLP-4SAwRust-4DynProg [Dynamic Programming](https://liveproject.manning.com/project/1555)

The aim of this project is to develop the dynamic programming skills needed to build a system that derives the optimum selection of items that maximises total value while minimising weight (or volume). This is known as the *0-1 Knapsack Problem* which seems simple enough, but is one of the harder problems in theoretical computer science. Several different approaches will be explored to find solutions.

There are four Milestones in this project. Details of each can be seen by clicking a link below:
