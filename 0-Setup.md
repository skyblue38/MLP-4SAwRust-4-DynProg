See [Project Prerequisites and Resources](https://liveproject.manning.com/module/1555_1_5/dynamic-programming-rust/introduction/prerequisites-and-resources?) for the official project specification.

This author chose to run the project in a local Linux Virtual Machine environment provided by [VirtualBOX](https://www.virtualbox.org) on a Windows 10 PC. This offered the advantages of: 
* concurrent dual screen visuals and panels with Cut-n-Paste features,
* independent access to the internet (especially GitHUB),
* local file storage, printing and applications in Windows,
* use of a MarkDown editor ([Obsidian](https://obsidian.md)) to prepare documents.
